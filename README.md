# Security Key USB drive

This project aims to create a USB thumb drive-based security key system, similar to a YubiKey, where each USB drive can be configured to trigger specific actions upon being plugged in or unplugged.
The application allows users to customize the behavior of each key, including defining actions like running scripts or files, passing key-specific data as argument to those.
The system also supports features like multiple key assignments, USB cloning (future).

## Features

### ‚úÖ Config UI
- [x] The user should be able to configure what each key does.
- [x] The user should be able to put labels on each key.

### ‚úÖ Detection of Thumb Drive Events
- [x] Detect when a thumb drive is plugged in.
- [x] Detect when a thumb drive is unplugged.

### üü© Actions on USB Plug/Unplug
- [x] **Action on Plug**: 
  - [x] Upon plug, specify an action (run a file).
  - [x] Pass the hash of the key ID/data as a configurable parameter.
- [x] **Action on Unplug**: 
  - [x] Upon unplug, specify an action (run a file).
  - [x] Pass the hash of the key ID/data as a configurable parameter.

### USB Cloning
- [ ] Allow the user to clone USB Security Keys.

### üîê Security
- [x] Config and actions for security concerns should be saved on the user's system to prevent unauthorized code execution.
- [ ] Encrypt configuration files to avoid tampering.

## Other Features

- [x] **Multiple Keys**: Allow multiple keys to be assigned to one action (for backup in case of loss).
